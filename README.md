# Exposed Imdb

**NOTE : I am archiving this project because imdb [closed access to its datasets](https://developer.imdb.com/) and I could not find any other complete equivalents online. Sorry!**    

A simple project to learn more about [exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed), using the [imdb datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/).

Please note that if you use this project, you have to comply with the [Imbd license](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

## Learnings
